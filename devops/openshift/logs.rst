Getting Started
---------------

#. Log in on https://logging.appuio.ch.

.. figure:: logs/main_page.png
   :scale: 80%

#. Import *saved searches* (only after first login)

   #. Download `this file </_static/download/kibana_searches.json>`__
   #. Import it via *Settings* → *Objects* → *Import*

#. Open *saved searches* menu

#. Select a *saved search*

   Select ``Nice`` to get the Nice event logs or ``Nginx`` to get the Nginx access logs.

#. Show all projects

#. Select Project

   There is one project per installation.

#. Select a time frame

.. warning::

   When selecting a *saved search* (step 2) you're automatically switched to the project that's associated with the
   search. Ensure it is the right project (step 4).

.. hint::

   For more information have a look at `Kibana User Guide`_, in particular the `Discover`_ section and
   `Lucene Query Syntax`_.


Query Syntax
------------

.. figure:: logs/query.png
   :scale: 80%

1. Search for **ModelException** in field *stack_trace*.

2. The word **ERROR** must be contained in the result. Without the **+**, the results matching closest the query are
   returned even if they don't contain all search terms.

3. Filter out all results that contain the word **runtime**.

4. Search for the phrase **some text** rather than the words **some** and **text**. You may also have to use quotes if
   the search term contains special characters. For instance, if it contains a hyphen, like **start-up**, it is treated
   as two words. Using ``"start-up"`` avoids this. In case you want to search a particular field, use
   ``message:"my search term"``.
