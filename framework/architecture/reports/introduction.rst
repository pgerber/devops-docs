Introduction to Reports
=======================

New reports use :term:`Freemarker` to generate HTML that's then converted
to PDF by :doc:`wkhtmltopdf <wkhtmltopdf>`.

Older reports may still use :term:`PD4ML` for the conversion from HTML to PDF or may
use an entirely different technology called :term:`JasperReports`.
