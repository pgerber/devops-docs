SQL Snippets (Postgres)
=======================

Show Queries Running in Postgres
--------------------------------

Show all Queries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: sql

    SELECT
      datname,
      now() - query_start as time,
      query
    FROM
      pg_stat_activity
    WHERE
      state = 'active';

Show Queries Running on DB
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Show queries on ``DB_NAME``:

.. code:: sql

    SELECT
      now() - query_start as time,
      query
    FROM
      pg_stat_activity
    WHERE
      datname = 'DB_NAME' AND state = 'active';

Show Long Running Queries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Show Queries that have been Running for more than 5 Minutes:

.. code:: sql

   SELECT
     pid,
     now() - query_start as time,
     datname,
     query
   FROM
     pg_stat_activity
   WHERE
     state = 'active'
     AND now() - query_start > interval '5m'
  ORDER BY
     query_start;

.. hint::

   You can terminate any running query using the number shown in the ``pid`` column:

   ``SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid);``


Forcibly Close Connections to DB
--------------------------------

Close all connections to DB ``DB_NAME``.

.. code:: sql

    SELECT
      pg_terminate_backend(pg_stat_activity.pid)
    FROM
      pg_stat_activity
    WHERE
      pg_stat_activity.datname = 'DB_NAME'
      AND pid <> pg_backend_pid();
