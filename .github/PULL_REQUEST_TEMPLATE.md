### Contributor checklist
<!-- replace the empty checkboxes [ ] below with checked ones [x] accordingly -->
- [ ] My contribution is **ready to be merged** as is
- [ ] I verified the modifications **render properly**
- [ ] I used **spell checking**
- [ ] I introduced **no new warnings** during build or declared them here
- [ ] I **used the styling and structure aids available** in [Sphinx/ResT](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html). (Links use `` `…`_``, enumerations `#.`, lists `*`, code ``` ``…`` ```/`.. code::`, warnings .. `warning::`, etc.)
- [ ] I reread the text keeping in mind that the text has to be **comprehended** fully **by the target audience**
